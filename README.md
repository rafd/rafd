I work full time on side-projects. Mostly web apps. Exclusively in Clojure.

Currently, my main focus is on creating [a space for massively collaborative online ventures](https://www.bloomventures.io/wtf.html).

Interested in learning Clojure? I host a [monthly Beginner's Chat with Clojure Toronto](https://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Toronto/) and a [weekly live-code session](https://www.notion.so/ClojoDojo-c60710d629ab4fc4877f526a790ec5bc) with ClojoDojo.

## Talks

Occasionally, when I have something interesting on my mind, I attempt to distill it into a somewhat comprehensible talk:

- ðŸ“º [Solving Problems the Clojure Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK1DazRK_a0)

     My attempt at explaining two of the core pillars of Clojure programming: functional programming and data-oriented programming. Features a step-by-step refactor of imperative code to functional code (in Javascript).
       
     "This is by far the best talk I've seen explaining functional programming" <- someone on YouTube, so you should definitely trust them
     
- ðŸ“º [Declarative Domain Logic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFQlpBEpeks)

    Domain Modeling via Data-Oriented programming in Clojure? 
    
- ðŸ“º [Composing Applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HpI7d3-hpo)
  
    Organizing code by features to enable "append-only" programming for web applications.


## Background

One summer, when I was but a wee lad of 12, my mom won a spot at a programming course in a private college. She didn't stick with it, but I used the books she bought to learn the basics of HTML + CSS + JS + PHP and started making shitty websites for people. I moved on to making stuff with Flash, and then with Rails 1.0. Eventually, I developed a distate for magic, dabbled briefly with the early Node ecosystem, and eventually discovered the simplicity of Clojure, which has kept me happy for the last 8+ years.

I program mostly for the joy of creation. I make things mostly to explore ideas and to solve problems for myself or others.

My goal in life is to maximize the value I create for others, and to help others do the same.

I spent 4 grueling years earning a degree in energy-systems engineering, which to the chagrin of my parents, I've put to no use whatsoever.  

For the last few years, I've been doing a mix of startups (not-yet-successful), consulting (life-draining), teaching (rewarding) and traveling (environmentally-questionable).
