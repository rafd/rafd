I build ventures. Mostly web apps. Exclusively in Clojure.

Currently, my main focus is on creating [a space for massively collaborative online ventures](https://www.vntrhb.com).

Interested in learning Clojure? I host a weekly mob sessions via [Clojure Camp](https://handbook.clojure.camp/).

## Talks

Occasionally, when I have something interesting on my mind, I attempt to distill it into a somewhat comprehensible talk:

- ðŸ“º [Solving Problems the Clojure Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK1DazRK_a0)

     My attempt at explaining two of the core pillars of Clojure programming: functional programming and data-oriented programming. Features a step-by-step refactor of imperative code to functional code (in Javascript).
       
     "This is by far the best talk I've seen explaining functional programming" <- someone on YouTube, so you should definitely trust them
     
- ðŸ“º [Data-Oriented Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kc55qOgGps)

     I try to distill "data-oriented programming" and "data-driven programming," as practised by the Clojure community.
   
- ðŸ“º [Declarative Domain Logic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFQlpBEpeks)

    Domain Modeling via Data-Oriented programming in Clojure? 
    
- ðŸ“º [Composing Applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HpI7d3-hpo)
  
    Organizing code by features to enable "append-only" programming for web applications.


## Background

When I was 12, my mom won a spot at a programming course at a private college. She didn't stick with it, but I used the books she bought to learn the basics of HTML + CSS + JS + PHP and started making shitty websites for people (with heavy use of Flash animations). I discovered Rails, built a lot of little web apps with it, and also learned Ruby as a result. I made a single project with the early Node ecosystem, but after being introduced to the simplicity of Clojure, it has kept me happy for the last 10+ years.

I program mostly for the joy of creation. I make things mostly to explore ideas and to solve problems for myself or others.

My goal in life is to maximize the value I create for others, and to help others do the same.

I spent 4 grueling years earning a degree in energy-systems engineering, which to the chagrin of my parents, I've put to no use whatsoever.  

For the last few years, I've been doing a mix of startups (not-yet-successful), consulting (life-draining), teaching (rewarding) and traveling (environmentally-questionable).
